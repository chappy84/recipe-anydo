Recipe for Any.do integration with Franz 5

## Archived

I've recently switched from Franz to [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/) (a fork of Franz that is receiving regular updates).  
Anyway, they maintain their own [Any.do plugin](https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-recipes/tree/main/recipes/anydo), so I no longer need to maintain this. Do with this code what you will, but unmodified, it most likely won't work longer term due to any updates Any.do implement in their HTML / CSS.

## Installation
1. To install this plugin, download the zip [here](https://github.com/chappy84/recipe-anydo/archive/master.zip)
2. Open the file, and extract the contents to a folder e.g. `anydo`
3. Open the Franz Plugins folder on your machine (note that this `dev` directory may not exist yet, and you must create it):
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/`
  * Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev`
3. Copy the `anydo` folder created in step 2 into the plugins directory
4. Reload Franz
